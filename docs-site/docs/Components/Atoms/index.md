# Atoms
Atoms are the foundational building blocks of the design system. They represent the simplest UI elements, such as buttons, inputs, labels, and icons. Atoms are highly reusable and serve as the basis for more complex components.

## Usage

Atoms are designed to be used independently or combined to form molecules and organisms. They follow consistent styling and accessibility guidelines.

```jsx
import { Button, Input, Label } from '@your-library/atoms';

<Label htmlFor="username">Username</Label>
<Textfield id="username" type="text" />
<Button>Submit</Button>
```

Refer to each atom's documentation for detailed usage and customization options.
