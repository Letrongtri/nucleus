# Components
Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking user interfaces down into their fundamental building blocks. It consists of five distinct stages:

1. **Atoms**: The basic elements such as buttons, inputs, and labels. These are the smallest functional units.
2. **Molecules**: Simple groups of atoms functioning together as a unit, like a search form composed of an input and a button.
3. **Organisms**: Complex components formed by combining molecules and/or atoms, such as a navigation bar.


This approach promotes consistency, reusability, and scalability in UI development.
